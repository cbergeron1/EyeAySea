# EyeAySea (Infrastructure As Code)

Hi! This repository is the home for all of my personal Infrastructure as Code. I work as an infrastructure developer so staying up to date on the latest releases of Terraform the new features that follow are important to me! This repo will house my TFE, Github, and AWS Infrastructure that is used in projects.

# Workspaces

Each `folder` maps to a unique TFE workspace in my TFE Cloud account. There is a parent directory know as `Mothership`. This houses my different TFE Organization Creation and all TFE/Variable Creation.
